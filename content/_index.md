Hello, I'm [Leon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devleon/). I'm an embedded engineer passionate about building IoT products from concept to mass production.
I have expertise in hardware design, firmware development, connectivity protocols, data analytics, machine learning and edge AI.

This website aims to showcase my personal projects, and to be a place for me to share anecdotes about working with embedded systems and Rust.
